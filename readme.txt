== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does your support video and other embeds? =

Yes!

= Do you offer layout tools, buttons or other functionality? =

Our free plugin allows you to make headlines, add images, links 
and media. Our pro version allows you to create layouts, add
buttons, and more. Please visit our website at: http://prowriter.co
to learn more

= Does your plugin work with shortcodes? =

Our free plugin ghosts shortcodes by coloring them gray, preventing you
from overwriting them. You will still be able to edit the rest of 
the copy of your pages as well as text in between.

The pro version of our plugin will work with all shortcodes, allowing
you to edit pages and posts with all their extended functionality visible in
edit mode.

= Do I need to have the admin bar visible to use Pro Writer? =

The free version uses the WordPress admin bar, and is necessary for operation.

the pro version of our plugin does not need the admin bar to operate.
